This readme takes you through the steps involved in building prompt.
You will need the following jars:

   protege.jar
   protege-owl.jar
   changes.jar
   rdf-backend.jar.

The sources for these jars can be found in the following svn repositories:

    http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/protege-core/trunk
    http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/owl/trunk
    http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/change-management/trunk
    http://smi-protege.stanford.edu/repos/protege/rdf-backend/trunk.

Copy the four jar files into the lib directory and type "ant dist".
As a result of a successful compile, the dist directory will contain a
file prompt.zip which is suitable for unzipping into the plugins
directory of a protege distribution.  In addition the prompt.jar can
be found in dist/edu.stanford.smi.protegex.prompt.
