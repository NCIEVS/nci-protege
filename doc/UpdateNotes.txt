On a software update in the server, re lucene indexing, if a database doesn't need to be rebuilt, just copy the lucene directory.  If the database is rebuilt, then re-index.  The pprj files would remain the same.  

- If the name of the pprj changes, then re-index or rename the subdirectory under lucene?  Or is there an absolute path somewhere and we definitely need to regenerate the indices?

- copying lucene index after update from 1.1.x to 1.1.y works (as long as the pprjs are the same)

- on QA build copy from a previous running QA instance
	examples/NCIThesaurus, 
	examples/NCIPizza, 
	examples/server

- on QA build update from previous running QA instance
	run_rmiregistry.sh
	run_protege_server_nci.sh
	shutdown_protege_server.sh


include run_rmiregistry.sh as a separate script?


-------------------------

Production from "stage"

- copy "stage" to a sibling directory of production, includes Client, Admin, Server, and Explanation
- on new build update Server files from previous running prod instance
	run_rmiregistry.sh
	run_protege_server_nci.sh
	shutdown_protege_server.sh
	PromptNCIPlugin.properties
- on new build copy the start script from the previous Explanation server instance, edit it to point to the correct Protege build
- on new build copy examples/server and examples/NCIThesaurus directory/files from previous running prod
- on new build copy "lucene" from previous running prod unless there has been a database load, then you'll need to re-index from the AQP
